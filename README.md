# amazonappclone

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

A new Flutter project. This is an online storefront using the Flutter framework. This shopping application makes use of Javascript, Node, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose for the backend. Additionally, this Flutter project covers the entire Amazon user interface, including features like login with an email address and password, cart, product search, category-based product retrieval, star rating, deal of the day retrieval, GPay/Apple Pay checkout, order details, and status viewing, total sales view, and category-based sales graph.
Also included are the establishment of REST APIs, data storage in MongoDB using Mongoose, use of REST APIs with Flutter and Dart using Models, use of the Flutter State Management tool as a Provider, and development of a cross-platform program.
